title: Dynamo + MatrixHub integration experiment
description: Running Dynamo on a GPU Kubernetes cluster while pulling model weights from an in-cluster MatrixHub, and comparing first-download time against public Hugging Face.
---

We ran two experiments to measure how much an in-network MatrixHub speeds up the first model-weight download for a Dynamo inference service.

- **Experiment 1**: Deploy Dynamo on a GPU Kubernetes cluster and pull model weights from an internal MatrixHub. The result is an OpenAI-compatible inference service that can answer chat requests for the `qwen3-0.6b` model.
- **Experiment 2**: Repeat the same setup, but pull the weights from public Hugging Face instead, and compare the first-download time of the two runs.

## Experiment 1

### Environment

- **Dynamo is installed** — the Dynamo operator is already deployed in the cluster and can pick up the deployment file in step 2 and bring up the service automatically.
- **GPU node** — one NVIDIA A800 80GB, sliceable into 10 vGPUs. The node runs HAMi (a GPU virtualization component) that splits a physical GPU into several slices so multiple services can share the same card.
- **In-network model hub (MatrixHub)** — a MatrixHub model-weight registry is deployed internally (`matrixhub.internal:30001`). Weights are pulled from here, never over the public internet. The `chenyang-qwen/qwen3-0.6b` model was pre-cached on MatrixHub with `hf download`.
- **Network reachability** — the cluster node `<cluster-node>` can pull container images (nvcr.io) and reach the internal weight source MatrixHub (`matrixhub.internal:30001`).

Confirm the above first, especially that **Dynamo** and **vGPU** are ready.

### Before you start

- The cluster kubeconfig file
- A machine with `kubectl` installed

### Step 1: Connect to the cluster

Open a terminal and set the kubeconfig (do this once per new terminal):

```bash
# Replace with the actual path to your kubeconfig file
export KUBECONFIG=<path-to-your-kubeconfig>
```

Verify connectivity:

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

If you see the node list, you are good.

### Step 2: Prepare the deployment file

Create a file `dgd-vllm-vgpu.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
apiVersion: nvidia.com/v1alpha1
kind: DynamoGraphDeployment
metadata:
  name: vllm-qwen-vgpu
  namespace: dynamo-system
spec:
  services:
    Frontend:
      componentType: frontend
      replicas: 1
      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: "2"
          memory: "4Gi"
        limits:
          cpu: "2"
          memory: "4Gi"
      extraPodSpec:
        mainContainer:
          image: nvcr.io/nvidia/ai-dynamo/vllm-runtime:1.1.1
          workingDir: /workspace
          env:
            - { name: HF_ENDPOINT, value: "http://matrixhub.internal:30001" }
          command: ["python3", "-m", "dynamo.frontend"]
          args: ["--http-port", "8000"]

    decode:
      componentType: worker
      subComponentType: decode
      replicas: 1
      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: "4"
          memory: "16Gi"
          custom:
            nvidia.com/vgpu: "1"          # 1 vGPU slice
            nvidia.com/gpumem: "10000"    # memory limit, MB (~10GB)
            nvidia.com/gpucores: "30"     # compute limit, 0-100
        limits:
          cpu: "4"
          memory: "16Gi"
          custom:
            nvidia.com/vgpu: "1"
            nvidia.com/gpumem: "10000"
            nvidia.com/gpucores: "30"
      extraPodSpec:
        mainContainer:
          image: nvcr.io/nvidia/ai-dynamo/vllm-runtime:1.1.1
          workingDir: /workspace
          env:
            - { name: HF_ENDPOINT, value: "http://matrixhub.internal:30001" }
          command: ["python3", "-m", "dynamo.vllm"]
          args:
            - --model
            - chenyang-qwen/qwen3-0.6b
            - --served-model-name
            - chenyang-qwen/qwen3-0.6b
            - --tensor-parallel-size
            - "1"
            - --gpu-memory-utilization
            - "0.85"
            - --max-model-len
            - "8192"
            - --no-enable-log-requests
```

Note: the `HF_ENDPOINT` environment variable points to the internal MatrixHub address `http://matrixhub.internal:30001`.

Common things you may want to change later:

| What to change | Where |
|---|---|
| Switch model | replace both `chenyang-qwen/qwen3-0.6b` with the new model name |
| More GPU memory | raise both `nvidia.com/gpumem: "10000"` (unit MB) |
| More compute | raise both `nvidia.com/gpucores: "30"` (max 100) |

### Step 3: Deploy

```bash
kubectl apply -f dgd-vllm-vgpu.yaml
```

### Step 4: Wait for it to come up

```bash
kubectl -n dynamo-system get pods -l nvidia.com/dynamo-graph-deployment-name=vllm-qwen-vgpu -w
```

Wait until both pods show `1/1 Running` (the first deploy pulls images and may take a few minutes).

**Check the service logs:**

```bash
kubectl -n dynamo-system logs <pod-name> --tail=50
```

Because MatrixHub is deployed internally and the model is already cached (`HF_ENDPOINT` points to MatrixHub), the model download takes about 10 seconds:

![Model download ~10s](/img/blog/dynamo-matrixhub/download-10s.png)

### Step 5: Test the service

First get the frontend pod name:

```bash
kubectl -n dynamo-system get pods | grep frontend
```

Test with that name (replace `<frontend-pod>` with what you found above):

```bash
kubectl -n dynamo-system exec <frontend-pod> -- curl -s http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model":"chenyang-qwen/qwen3-0.6b","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Introduce yourself in one sentence"}],"max_tokens":64}'
```

If the model returns a reply, the deployment succeeded.

## Experiment 2

Everything else is identical to Experiment 1. Just remove the `HF_ENDPOINT` environment variable from the deployment YAML, and it falls back to pulling model weights from public Hugging Face.

Without MatrixHub (downloading from public Hugging Face), the logs show the model download takes about 6 minutes:

## Results: first-download time comparison

Measured per-stage timings for the two cases — "internal MatrixHub with the model pre-cached" vs. "no MatrixHub" — using the `qwen3-0.6b` model. **Dynamo's first-download comparison is shown below:**

| Stage | Experiment 1 (internal MatrixHub, model cached) | Experiment 2 (no MatrixHub) |
|---|---|---|
| Pull container image (10GB+) | seconds (cached on node) | seconds (cached on node) |
| Download model weights | **~10 s (from internal MatrixHub cache)** | **~6 min (from public Hugging Face)** |
| vLLM engine start + model load | 1–2 min | 1–2 min |

## Conclusion

An in-network MatrixHub significantly accelerates Dynamo's first model-weight download.
