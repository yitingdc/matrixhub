# Security Policy

## Supported versions

MatrixHub provides security fixes for maintained release branches. Versions that are end-of-life (EOL) do not receive security updates.

| Version | Supported |
|---------|-----------|
| Latest release | Yes |
| Previous minor release | Best effort |
| Older releases | No |

Check [GitHub releases](https://github.com/matrixhub-ai/matrixhub/releases) for the current supported version.

## Scope

**In scope** (please report):

- The MatrixHub source code in this repository
- Official container images (`ghcr.io/matrixhub-ai/matrixhub`) and the Helm chart
- Authentication, authorization, multi-tenancy, and data-isolation issues

**Out of scope** (please do not file as vulnerabilities):

- The public demo at [demo.matrixhub.ai](https://demo.matrixhub.ai/) and its
  documented default credentials (`admin` / `changeme`) — these are intentional for
  evaluation only.
- Vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies that are already publicly known and do
  not have a MatrixHub-specific impact (these are tracked via Dependabot).
- Issues that require physical access, a compromised host, or misconfiguration
  contrary to the hardening guidance below.

If you are unsure whether something is in scope, report it — we would rather triage a
borderline report than miss a real issue.

## Security contacts

Security reports and triage are handled by the active maintainers listed in [MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md).

For vulnerability reports, use the private reporting channel described below (not public issues or maintainer DMs).

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

### Preferred: GitHub private security advisory

1. Go to [Security advisories](https://github.com/matrixhub-ai/matrixhub/security/advisories) for this repository.
2. Choose **Report a vulnerability** and submit details.

Maintainers will acknowledge receipt and work with you on coordinated disclosure.

We currently accept vulnerability reports **only via [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/matrixhub-ai/matrixhub/security/advisories)**. A dedicated security email alias may be added later.

When submitting an advisory, include:

- Description of the issue and impact
- Steps to reproduce
- Affected versions or commits
- Any proof-of-concept or logs (avoid sharing secrets)

### Bug bounty

There is **no bug bounty program** at this time.

## Response expectations

| Stage | Target |
|-------|--------|
| Initial acknowledgment | Within **3 business days** |
| Triage and severity assessment | Within **7 business days** |
| Fix or mitigation plan | Depends on severity; critical issues prioritized |

These are goals, not guarantees. Complex issues may take longer.

## Disclosure process

1. Reporter submits a private [GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/matrixhub-ai/matrixhub/security/advisories).
2. Maintainers confirm the issue, assign severity, and develop a fix (often on a private branch).
3. A patched release is published; credit is given to the reporter if desired.
4. A public advisory is published via [GitHub Security Advisories (GHSA)](https://github.com/matrixhub-ai/matrixhub/security/advisories), and a **CVE ID is requested** where applicable. Release notes reference the fix.

We follow **coordinated disclosure**. We aim to disclose publicly once a fix is
available, and ask reporters to observe an embargo of up to **90 days** from the
initial report before public disclosure, to give users time to upgrade. We are happy
to coordinate timing with the reporter and other affected projects.

## Automated security scanning

MatrixHub runs the following checks in CI:

| Check | Scope | Workflow | Output |
|-------|-------|----------|--------|
| **govulncheck** | Go dependencies & stdlib | `govulncheck.yml` | PR check (blocks on known vulns) |
| **CodeQL** | Go + JS/TS static analysis | `codeql.yml` | GitHub Security tab (SARIF) |
| **Trivy** | Container image CVEs | `call-release-image.yaml` | GitHub Security tab (SARIF) |
| **Dependabot** | Go, npm, Actions, Docker | `dependabot.yml` | Automated PRs + security alerts |
| **Cosign + SBOM** | Release images | `call-release-image.yaml` | Signed images with SPDX SBOM |

All scanning workflows start **non-blocking** (report-only). After initial triage they are promoted to required checks on `main`.

## Security hardening (operators)

MatrixHub is often deployed on private networks. Operators should:

- Restrict network access to the API and admin UI
- Use strong authentication, TLS, and secrets management
- Keep dependencies and container images updated
- Follow your organization’s model-artifact and supply-chain policies

## Supply chain security

MatrixHub publishes signed artifacts to help you verify provenance:

- **Signed container images.** Release images are signed **keylessly** with
  [Cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/) using GitHub Actions OIDC (Fulcio/Rekor), so
  no long-lived signing keys are involved.
- **Software Bill of Materials (SBOM).** An SPDX SBOM is generated for each release
  image and attached alongside it.

Verify an image and download its SBOM:

```bash
# Verify the signature (keyless, GitHub Actions OIDC)
cosign verify \
  --certificate-identity-regexp 'https://github.com/matrixhub-ai/matrixhub/.*' \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer 'https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com' \
  ghcr.io/matrixhub-ai/matrixhub:<tag>

# Download the attached SBOM
cosign download sbom ghcr.io/matrixhub-ai/matrixhub:<tag>
```
